# License Plate Recognition - Deployment Options

This document provides an overview of different deployment options for the License Plate Recognition application.

## Option 1: Render.com (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Simple deployment process
- Good documentation
- Supports Python applications well
- Free tier with sufficient resources
- Allows installation of system packages like Tesseract
- Persistent storage options available

**Cons:**
- Free tier goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Limited compute resources (512 MB RAM, 0.1 CPU)

For detailed deployment instructions, see [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Option 2: Railway.app (Alternative)

**Pros:**
- Very developer-friendly interface
- $5 free usage per month
- 512 MB RAM and shared CPU
- Easy GitHub integration
- Good for small-to-medium apps

**Cons:**
- Usage-based pricing may lead to unexpected charges if traffic spikes
- Doesn't persist files between deployments without external storage

For detailed deployment instructions, see [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Option 3: Local Deployment

**Pros:**
- Complete control over the environment
- No resource limitations
- Can use TensorFlow for better detection accuracy
- Can install Tesseract for better OCR
- No connectivity issues or latency

**Cons:**
- Not accessible from the internet
- Requires local machine to be running
- Setup can be complex depending on your OS

To run locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - **Windows**: Download and install from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app_simplified.py
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

## Deployment Comparison

| Feature | Render | Railway | Local |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| Cost | Free tier available | $5 free credits/month | Free |
| Public URL | Yes | Yes | No (unless port forwarded) |
| RAM | 512 MB | 512 MB | System dependent |
| CPU | 0.1 CPU | Shared CPU | System dependent |
| Storage | Ephemeral | Ephemeral | Persistent |
| TensorFlow Support | Limited | Limited | Full |
| Tesseract OCR | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Sleep on Inactivity | Yes (15 min) | No (until credits used) | No |

## Choosing the Right Option

- **For a public demo with limited usage**: Render.com is ideal
- **For more consistent availability**: Railway.app works well
- **For development or personal use**: Local deployment is best

## Tips for Successful Deployment

1. **Optimize image processing**: Resize images before processing to reduce memory usage
2. **Use simplified models**: The app_simplified.py version works best on limited resources
3. **Handle storage carefully**: Cloud deployments have ephemeral storage, so implement external storage for important files
4. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check application logs for errors and warnings
5. **Test thoroughly**: Always test your deployment with various images to ensure it works correctly
